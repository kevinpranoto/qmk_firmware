# Custom keymap for Boardwalk keyboard for layout ortho_2x2u

Features delayed key activation, so some keys can be cancelled when accidentally tapped. 

I mapped my `PGDN`, `PDUP`, `HOME`, and `END` keys in the middle of my board, so to prevent accidental presses, I created a simple function to only trigger them if pressed longer than 200ms.
